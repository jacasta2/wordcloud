# wordcloud

In this repo I provide a notebook to create a wordcloud I use as part of a gig image for [my first published gig in Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/share/XDe00D). The implementation relies on work from my colleague [Juan Fernando Varela](https://github.com/JFVJ/Lemmatization-in-Spanish-Wordcloud-) and the blog entry [Word Cloud in 3 Basic Steps with Python](https://gustavorsantos.medium.com/word-cloud-in-3-basic-steps-with-pythonb-c5a97537b9d6).

I highly appreciate feedback and you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://bit.ly/jaime-linkedin) any time. I'm also working on other projects. Check this out in my [personal website](https://bit.ly/jaime-website).

Thanks for reading!
